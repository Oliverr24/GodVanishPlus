# GodVanishPlus
GodVanishPlus plugin for Unturned servers.
GodVanishPlus makes it easier for server owners and administrators to monitor the staff members use of god and vanish modes on the server. It allows anyone with FTP access to view the file of all staff kills with God or Vanish enabled, along with the option to allow public announcing of admin abuse.

Commands:
- /god
- /god <player>
- /vanish
- /vanish <player>
- /checkmode <player>
